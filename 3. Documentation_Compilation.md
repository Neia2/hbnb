**0. High-Level Package Diagram**  

This diagram shows how the application is organised into different layers, each layer, three layer having a specific role in the operation of the system.  

**1-First layer**

Role:  
This is the part that is visible to the user, such as a website or an API. This layer receives user requests (for example, when a user wants to view or add an ad).  

Composant:  
Services and APIs: These are the functionalities that the application offers to the user or to other systems.  

Facade Interface    
Role:  
This is an intermediary that simplifies communication between the presentation layer (which the user sees) and the business logic (which manages the application's rules).  

But: To ensure that the presentation layer does not need to know all the internal details, it simply passes through this interface.  

**2-BusinessLogicLayer**   
Rôle : C'est le cerveau de l'application. Elle contient toutes les règles de gestion des annonces, des utilisateurs, des avis, etc.  

**3-PersistenceLayer**  
Role: This is where the data is stored (like a database).  

Data access and storage engine: These are used to save and retrieve information (such as adverts or users) in a database.  

To conclude:  
The presentation (what the user sees) communicates with the front-end to access the business logic (the application rules), which then connects to the database to save or retrieve data
