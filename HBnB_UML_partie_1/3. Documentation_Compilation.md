### Documentation Compilation  
  
## High-Level Package Diagram**  
  
This diagram shows how the application is organised into different layers, each layer, three layer having a specific role in the operation of the system.  
  
# 1-First layer  
  
Role:  
This is the part that is visible to the user, such as a website or an API. This layer receives user requests (for example, when a user wants to view or add an ad).  

Composant:  
Services and APIs: These are the functionalities that the application offers to the user or to other systems.  

Facade Interface    
Role:  
This is an intermediary that simplifies communication between the presentation layer (which the user sees) and the business logic (which manages the application's rules).  

But: To ensure that the presentation layer does not need to know all the internal details, it simply passes through this interface.  
  
# 2-BusinessLogicLayer  
Rôle : C'est le cerveau de l'application. Elle contient toutes les règles de gestion des annonces, des utilisateurs, des avis, etc.  

**3-PersistenceLayer**  
Role: This is where the data is stored (like a database).  

Data access and storage engine: These are used to save and retrieve information (such as adverts or users) in a database.  

To conclude:  
The presentation (what the user sees) communicates with the front-end to access the business logic (the application rules), which then connects to the database to save or retrieve data  
 




## Business Logic Layer: Class Diagram Explanation

The class diagram provided illustrates the core components and relationships of the business logic layer for the HBnB project. The following section details each class and its role in the system.

Classes and Relationships

# 1. BaseModel

The BaseModel class acts as a foundation for all other entities in the system. It contains the following attributes and methods:

	•	Attributes:
	•	UUID: A unique identifier for each instance.
	•	datetime_created_at: The timestamp when the object is created.
	•	datetime_update_at: The timestamp when the object is last updated.
	•	Methods:
	•	save(): Persists changes to the object.
	•	update(): Updates the timestamp when changes are made.

This class is inherited by all other classes in the diagram, providing a consistent way to track creation and modification times for objects.

# 2. Class User

The User class represents individuals using the HBnB platform. Users can own places and leave reviews for places they visit.

	•	Attributes:
	•	FirstName: The user’s first name.
	•	LastName: The user’s last name.
	•	Email: The user’s email, used for authentication and communication.
	•	Password: The user’s password, securely stored and used for authentication.
	•	Methods:
	•	create_user(first_name, last_name, email, password): A method to create a new user.
	•	authenticate(email, password): Validates the user’s credentials during login.
	•	list_owner_places(): Retrieves a list of places owned by the user.

Each user can be associated with multiple places, as indicated by the relationship with the Place class.

# 3. Class Place

The Place class represents rental properties listed on the platform. Each place is associated with a specific user (the owner) and has numerous attributes detailing the property.

	•	Attributes:
	•	name: The name of the place.
	•	description: A description of the place.
	•	country: The country where the place is located.
	•	address: The address of the place.
	•	price: The price per night to rent the place.
	•	latitude and longitude: The geographical coordinates of the place.
	•	owner: The user who owns the place.
	•	numRooms: The number of rooms in the place.
	•	numBathroom: The number of bathrooms in the place.
	•	max_guests: The maximum number of guests allowed.
	•	reviews: Reviews left by users for this place.
	•	amenities: The amenities available at the place, such as Wi-Fi, parking, or pool access.
	•	Methods:
	•	get_info(): Returns all the information about the place.
	•	list_reviews(): Lists all reviews associated with the place.
	•	list_amenities(): Lists all amenities available at the place.
	•	create_place(): A method to create a new place listing.

Each place is linked to a User who owns it and can be reviewed by other users. Places also have relationships with amenities and reviews.

# 4. Class Review

The Review class allows users to leave feedback for places they have visited. Each review is associated with both a User and a Place.

	•	Attributes:
	•	User_id: The user who wrote the review.
	•	Place_id: The place being reviewed.
	•	Rating: An integer rating provided by the user.
	•	Comment: A text comment left by the user as part of the review.
	•	Methods:
	•	get_user_review(): Retrieves the review written by a specific user.
	•	get_place_review(): Retrieves all reviews for a particular place.
	•	add_review(user, place, rating, comment): Adds a new review to a place.

Reviews are critical for users to make informed decisions about places to stay. They contribute to the overall rating and reputation of a place.

# 5. Class City

The City class provides information about cities that have places listed on the platform. Each city is associated with a country.

	•	Attributes:
	•	Name: The name of the city.
	•	Country_id: The identifier of the country to which the city belongs.
	•	Methods:
	•	get_city_info(): Returns detailed information about the city.
	•	list_places(): Lists all places available in the city.

Cities are a key entity, helping users locate places based on geographical preferences.

# 6. Class Country

The Country class represents different countries on the platform, each associated with one or more cities.

	•	Attributes:
	•	Name: The name of the country.
	•	Code: The country code (e.g., “US” for the United States).
	•	Methods:
	•	get_country_info(): Provides detailed information about the country.
	•	list_cities(): Lists all cities within the country.

The Country class allows users to filter places and cities based on the country they are interested in visiting.

# 7. Class Amenity

The Amenity class represents amenities that can be associated with a place. Examples include Wi-Fi, air conditioning, pool access, and more.

	•	Attributes:
	•	Amenity_id: The unique identifier for the amenity.
	•	Amenity_Name: The name of the amenity.
	•	Methods:
	•	get_info(): Retrieves information about a specific amenity.
	•	list_places(): Lists all places that offer the specific amenity.

Amenities help users refine their search for a place by specifying the features they are looking for in a rental.

Design Decisions

	•	Inheritance: By using a common BaseModel, the design ensures that all entities (Users, Places, Reviews, etc.) have a consistent way of managing their lifecycle (creation, updates, etc.).
	•	Encapsulation: Each class has its own methods to encapsulate its functionality, making the codebase modular and easy to maintain.
	•	Scalability: The relationships between places, cities, countries, and amenities allow the system to scale, supporting the addition of new places, countries, or amenities without needing to modify existing code significantly.

Conclusion

The class diagram and the relationships between entities provide a well-structured foundation for the HBnB project. Each class has clearly defined responsibilities and attributes, and the use of inheritance and encapsulation ensures that the design is both scalable and maintainable.
