**AirBnB Clone - The HBnB Evolution**  

**Description**  


 The HBnB Evolution project is a comprehensive web application developed as part of the programme at Holberton School. It enables users to create, read, update and delete objects linked to Airbnb-type rentals. The application is based on a powerful backend, RESTful APIs and a simple but effective frontend. The project focuses on a number of technical aspects, from data serialisation and database management to deployment on servers.
